# A College Assignment to find the minimum spanning tree with Prim's Algorithm
Tested and compiled successfully on Ubuntu 16.04's terminal.

## Requirement
    1) sudo apt-get install graphviz 
             *graphviz is an external library that help me to construct a spanning tree on an image, which is shown down below
    

    
    
## Note
    1) Windows version of this can be done, instructions were given in the instruction.docx file.
    
    2) Screenshots of manual entering nodes information can be found at
            https://github.com/shinjiat/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/tree/master/Assignment%203/screenshots
    
    3) clear && g++ *.cpp *.h -o main && ./main
            This line of command will clear the terminal, compile all the cpp and header files, name the executable as "main" and then run it finally.
